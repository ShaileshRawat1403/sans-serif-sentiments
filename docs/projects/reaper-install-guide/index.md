# ðŸŽ§ Reaper Installation Guide (Versioned)

*A human-first guide to installing the DAW that does everythingâ€”except hold your hand.*

---

## ðŸ§­ Why Versioned Docs?

Reaper updates often. And with each major update comes:
- UI shifts  
- Theme changes  
- New features that alter the first-time setup

Thatâ€™s why we split the installation manual by version.  
So whether youâ€™re on **7.0** or the latest **7.1+**, youâ€™ll find exactly what you needâ€”**without guesswork.**
