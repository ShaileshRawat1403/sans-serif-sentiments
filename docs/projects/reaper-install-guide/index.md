A beginner-friendly, versioned guide to installing REAPER—the DAW that does everything, once you know where to start.

## Why Versioned Docs

REAPER updates often. And with each version comes:
- UI and layout shifts
- New features
- Changed defaults

To avoid confusion, we've split this guide by version—so you always get the most accurate and relevant steps for your setup.
