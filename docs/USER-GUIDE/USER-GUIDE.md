# USER GUIDE  
*How to Write Documentation Without Losing the Plot*

Welcome to the user guide for the **sans-serif-sentiments** project.  
This isn't your average documentation about documentation.  
This is a writer’s manual for writing manuals—without sounding like a manual.

---

## Who Is This For?

This guide is for:
- Writers who think “technical writing” is just a boring term for “corporate gray”
- Developers who document only when someone threatens their lunch break
- Contributors who want to write with clarity, consistency, and a tiny touch of soul

Whether you're creating a user manual, an API reference, or a how-to blog, this guide helps you write docs that **don’t just instruct—they resonate**.

## Why Another Writing Guide?

Because most guides:
- Assume you know what you’re doing
- Don’t explain *why* things are done that way
- Are as readable as your printer’s warranty

This one’s different.
It shows you how to:
- Write for when things **don’t** work (not just when they do)
- Consider how your doc will be read by a **developer**, a **designer**, or a **desperate team lead at 2:00 AM**
- Ask: “What’s the worst way this can be misunderstood?”—and then make it clearer

We respect your time, your sanity, and your tab limit.

## TL;DR

This is a minimalist yet detailed manual for writing helpful, honest, and human documentation.  
No buzzwords. No fluff. Just thoughtful writing for real people.

Let’s begin.

## 🧭 2. Before You Start

> Good documentation isn’t just written—it’s prepared for.  
> This section helps you avoid rookie mistakes and shows you how to *think* like a technical writer before you even open a text editor.

### 🛠️ Tools You’ll Need

| Tool | Why You Need It |
|------|-----------------|
| A Markdown Editor (like VS Code, Typora, Obsidian) | To write in plain text and preview documentation |
| A Style Guide (like this one) | To ensure consistency in tone, format, and terminology |
| A Clear Requirements Brief | So you don’t write blindly—know what the doc needs to achieve |
| A Documentation Plan | Helps you scope the document, audience, and outcomes before you write |
| Your Brain (fully charged) | You’ll need empathy, clarity, and curiosity—no automation replaces that (yet) |

---

### 🧠 Mindset Before You Begin

- Don’t write to *impress*—write to **guide**
- Start with the reader’s **intent**, not your outline
- Avoid assuming the reader knows what you know
- Be kind to the next person who will read your doc at 2AM with tired eyes

### 🚫 Don’t Do This (A Little Table of Shame)

| Mistake | What It Looks Like | What to Do Instead |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------|
| ❌ Jumping straight into steps | `1. Click the button...` | ✅ Start with a purpose |
| ❌ Overloading jargon | `Configure with advanced tokenization` | ✅ Use plain English unless it’s truly needed |
| ❌ Ignoring different roles | Only SMEs will understand | ✅ Write modularly: “If you're a support agent, skip to section 3…” |
| ❌ Writing like you’re bored | “Just open the thing” | ✅ Write like you care (but don’t overdo it) |

---

### ✅ TL;DR

Before writing anything:
- Get your tools and thinking aligned
- Set your intention
- Remember: good documentation is a conversation, not a command
