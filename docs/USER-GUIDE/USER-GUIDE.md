# USER GUIDE  
*How to Write Documentation Without Losing the Plot*

Welcome to the user guide for the **sans-serif-sentiments** project.  
This isn't your average documentation about documentation.  
This is a writer’s manual for writing manuals—without sounding like a manual.

---

## Who Is This For?

This guide is for:
- Writers who think “technical writing” is just a boring term for “corporate gray”
- Developers who document only when someone threatens their lunch break
- Contributors who want to write with clarity, consistency, and a tiny touch of soul

Whether you're creating a user manual, an API reference, or a how-to blog, this guide helps you write docs that **don’t just instruct—they resonate**.

## Why Another Writing Guide?

Because most guides:
- Assume you know what you’re doing
- Don’t explain *why* things are done that way
- Are as readable as your printer’s warranty

This one’s different.
It shows you how to:
- Write for when things **don’t** work (not just when they do)
- Consider how your doc will be read by a **developer**, a **designer**, or a **desperate team lead at 2:00 AM**
- Ask: “What’s the worst way this can be misunderstood?”—and then make it clearer

We respect your time, your sanity, and your tab limit.

## TL;DR

This is a minimalist yet detailed manual for writing helpful, honest, and human documentation.  
No buzzwords. No fluff. Just thoughtful writing for real people.

Let’s begin.
