# 🌿 sans-serif-sentiments

**Simple words. Sincere intent.**

Hello. I’m **Shailesh Rawat**, and this is my open portfolio and learning hub for human-first documentation.

This is more than a showcase—it's a space for writing that respects the reader, values clarity, and understands context.

## 🌱 Why This Exists

Documentation isn’t just about accuracy.  
It’s about trust, timing, and tone.  

This project explores how simple, sincere documentation can make tech feel more human—and more usable.

---

## 📂 Project Library

Each project reflects a real documentation pain point, rewritten with care:

- **Docs for the Sleep-Deprived Developer**  
  *API docs designed for tired minds and urgent problems.*

- **Guiding User Journeys**  
  *UX writing that doesn’t just instruct—it supports.*

- **The 1-Minute Explainer**  
  *Fact sheets that say more by saying less.*

- **A Thoughtfully Packaged Yes**  
  *Proposals that feel clear, intentional, and respectful.*

- [Style Guide](./STYLE-GUIDE/STYLE-GUIDE.md) — A living framework for clarity and empathy.

## 📚 Templates & Tools (Coming Soon)

- Empathy checklists
- Markdown starter kits
- Voice & tone sliders
- Content decision maps

---

## 🤝 This is for...

- Technical writers, UX writers, and product folks
- Developers who’ve suffered bad docs
- Curious learners who value clarity

If you've ever felt like documentation forgot about the human on the other side—this is for you.
